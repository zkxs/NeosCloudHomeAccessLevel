# NeosCloudHomeAccessLevel

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod that allows you to change your cloud home's default access level. Configure this mod via the mod configuration system.

## Notes
- When the mod is enabled, the Neos `-AnnounceHomeOnLAN` argument will do nothing.
- By default, this mod will set your home's access level to Private until you change the configuration.
- If you open your home manually, this mod will have no effect.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [CloudHomeAccessLevel.dll](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosCloudHomeAccessLevel/releases/latest/download/CloudHomeAccessLevel.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
